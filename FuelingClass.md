## Introduce Yourself ##
* Exits
* Emergency Meeting Location
* Bathrooms

## General Overview ##
* PPE
  * Gloves
  * Eye Pro
  * __Fuel__ Gloves
  * Hearing Protection
  * Apron, if needed
* Safety
  * In case of a spill: 915-744-6393 from 0900-1600
  * If fuel spilled on yourself, remove clothes, dump water on yourself, flush eyes/mouth if needed
  * Fire Extinguisher - 20lbs or more
* Hazards
  * Heat
  * Static Electricity
  * Bad Fuel
  * Fuel Spills
  * Rotary Blades
* General Fueling
  * Grounding Rods / ground points / bonding
  * Fire Extinguisher of 20lbs at least at each fueling point
  * Drip Pans under each connection
    
* PPE
  * Why its important

# M969 Tanker #
* Trucks that can pull it:
  * M1088
  * M915

## Filter ##
* 15 Filter Elements
* 5 Coalescer Elements
* Then Go-No-Go Fuses

* ROM - Refuel On the Move
  * M969 is __ONE OF__ Primary Fuel Sources
* FARP - also __ONE OF__ Primary Fuel Sources
* Is filtered
* Has 2 50ft hoses at 1 1/4"
* 100 feet that separates each refueling point, with M969, you can fuel one aircraft with hose reels
* With connection on pump you can create more fueling points
* Has Water Drain valve on the bottom of the tank (Auto and Manual)

### Additives ###
* FSII - Fuel System Icing Inhibitor
* SDA - Static Disipating Additives
* CI - Corrosion Inhibitor

## Fueling System Capabilities ##
* AAFARS - We bring them fuel and leave
* FARP - We set up, they come to us, we fuel
* ROM - We are essentially "The Bag", we move to them

* OverWing - Wings over tank
  * This is more common
* UnderWing - wings under tank
  * This is less common
* Rotary
  * Enter at a 90 degree angle

## Fueling Steps for Aviation ##
* PPE
* Connect bonding connection to __GROUNDED__ vehicle via "headphone jack" connection
* Drip Pans
* Begin fueling
* Aviation crew should tell you when to stop, they go on weight, not gallons
  * One person at pump, one person fueling, one person watching pilot
