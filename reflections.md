>I have a general understanding of terminals now, whereas before I was not quite as familiar. While I have used terminals for various reasons, I have not spent much time at all in a terminal. Without a doubt, I have not spent as much time learning various commands. We may care about a terminal as it allows us to easily make changes, even remotely.

>After all of the video examples and exercises we have completed, I have differentiated between Git, the terminal, from GitHub, the web-based variation for hosting.

>Git is best described as
>* A terminal
>* Able to be used with VS Code to complete a given task
>* A program that does have differences between OS
>* A user friendly program that allows you to view your history
>
>Git would be most useful for a developer as it allows you to complete multiple tasks in one place, eliminating the needless window-switching worm hole of going from VS Code to Github, then back to VS Code.
